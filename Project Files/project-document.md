## 1. Summary
AI Closet Stylist is a mobile app that uses computer vision to scan and digitize users' wardrobes, then provides AI-powered outfit recommendations, resale price estimates, and donation suggestions. The app transforms wardrobe management from a manual, time-consuming process into an automated, intelligent system that helps users maximize their clothing's value and minimize waste.

## 2. Target User
Fashion-conscious individuals aged 25-45 who own substantial wardrobes but struggle with outfit planning, closet organization, and sustainable fashion decisions. They're tech-savvy, value convenience, care about sustainability, and want to make informed decisions about their clothing purchases and disposals. They often have items they've forgotten about, struggle to create new outfit combinations, and want to know the resale value of items before deciding to keep or donate them.

## 3. Core Problem
Users face three main pain points: (1) They forget what's in their closet, leading to duplicate purchases and underutilized items, (2) They struggle to create new outfit combinations, defaulting to the same few looks, and (3) They lack information about resale value and donation suitability when decluttering, leading to wasteful disposal of valuable items or keeping items that should be donated.

## 4. Value Proposition
Users gain complete visibility into their wardrobe with zero manual data entry, receive personalized outfit suggestions that help them rediscover and maximize their existing clothing, and make informed decisions about resale and donation that turn unused items into value while supporting sustainability. The app transforms wardrobe management from a chore into an intelligent system that saves time, money, and reduces fashion waste.

## 5. Core Features
- Wardrobe scanning: Computer vision automatically identifies, categorizes, and catalogs clothing items from photos
- AI outfit recommendations: Machine learning suggests outfit combinations based on weather, occasion, personal style, and existing wardrobe items
- Resale price estimation: Integration with resale marketplaces provides real-time price estimates for items based on brand, condition, and market demand
- Donation recommendations: AI identifies items suitable for donation based on condition, style trends, and user's wearing patterns
- Digital closet organization: Searchable, filterable digital inventory with tags, categories, and outfit history
- Style analytics: Insights on most/least worn items, outfit frequency, and wardrobe gaps

## 6. Differentiators
Unlike existing wardrobe apps that require manual entry or focus only on outfit suggestions, AI Closet Stylist combines automated scanning with comprehensive value analysis. The integration of resale pricing and donation recommendations is unique—most apps help organize but don't help users make disposal decisions. The computer vision scanning eliminates the biggest friction point (manual data entry) that causes users to abandon other wardrobe apps.

## 7. Homepage Angle
"Your entire wardrobe, digitized in minutes. Get AI-powered outfit suggestions, discover resale values, and identify items to donate—all from photos of your clothes." The hook is the speed and automation: no manual entry, instant insights, and actionable recommendations that save time and money.

## 8. Main SEO Entity
AI-powered wardrobe management and sustainable fashion technology

## 9. Constraints
Assumes users have smartphones with cameras and are willing to photograph their clothing. Resale price accuracy depends on marketplace data availability and item condition assessment. Outfit recommendations improve with usage data but require initial wardrobe scan. Donation recommendations are suggestions, not guarantees of acceptance. The app focuses on clothing, not accessories or shoes in the initial version.

## 10. Positioning Statement
"This is an AI-powered wardrobe management app for fashion-conscious consumers that helps them maximize their clothing's value through automated organization, personalized styling, and intelligent resale and donation recommendations."
